In text preprocessing, word embeddings are typically generated using unsupervised learning on large text corpora. Once trained, these embeddings can be used to represent words in numerical form, making them suitable for input to machine learning models. The embeddings serve as a foundational representation for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ans2

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to process sequential data, where the order of input elements matters. They are well-suited for text processing tasks because natural language is inherently sequential, and the meaning of a word often depends on the context of preceding words.

In text processing, RNNs can be used for various tasks, such as:

Sentiment analysis: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a text.
Named entity recognition: Identifying entities like names, locations, or dates in a sentence.
Language modeling: Predicting the next word in a sequence given the previous words.
Machine translation: Translating text from one language to another.
Text generation: Generating text based on a given prompt or context.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ans3

In machine translation, the encoder takes an input sequence in one language and transforms it into a fixed-length representation called the "context vector" or "thought vector." This context vector contains essential information about the input sequence and serves as the starting point for the decoder. The decoder then takes the context vector and generates the corresponding output sequence in the target language.

Preprocessing: The input text is preprocessed to remove noise, tokenize sentences, and convert words to numerical representations suitable for the model.

Model Training: The generative model is trained on a large dataset of text examples, such as books, articles, or conversations. During training, the model learns the patterns and structures of the language.
